# Data Concepts 


## The concepts of relational and non-relational data.

### Relational data
Relational data is structured data that follows a tabular format — like rows and columns in a table — and is stored in Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).

### Non Relational data
Non-relational data does not use tables to store information. Instead, it uses formats like documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores. These are stored in NoSQL databases.
