# Data Concepts 


## The concepts of relational and non-relational data.

### Relational data
Relational data is structured data that follows a tabular format — like rows and columns in a table — and is stored in Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).

### Non Relational data
Non-relational data does not use tables to store information. Instead, it uses formats like documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores. These are stored in NoSQL databases.

##Data can be classified as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

### Structured data - 
Structured data - adheres to a fixed schema, in tabular format , has the same fields or properties.
### Semi-structured data -
is information that has some structure, but which allows for some variation between entity instances. e.g. JSON
### Unstructured data -
documents, images, audio and video data, and binary files might not have a specific structure. This kind of data is referred to as unstructured data.

### Data store:
Organizations typically store data in structured, semi-structured, or unstructured format 
There are two broad categories of data store in common use:
- File stores
- Databases
