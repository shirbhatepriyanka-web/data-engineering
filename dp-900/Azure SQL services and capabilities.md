## Azure SQL services and capabilities
Azure SQL is a collective term for SQL Server based databases in Azure
### Specific Azure SQL services include:
- **SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines**
    - Runs full SQL Server in the cloud (no on-prem hardware needed).
    - It’s an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) solution.
    - Works like on-prem SQL Server — easy lift and shift migration.
    - Best for apps needing OS-level access or features not supported in PaaS.
    - Supports hybrid deployments (part on-prem, part in cloud).
    - Full admin control over SQL Server and OS.
    - Ideal for development/testing and fast migration.
    - Can scale up easily (add CPU, memory, disk) without reinstalling software.
      
      Business Benefits:
      - Use same tools and skills across on-prem and cloud.
      - Suitable when full managed service isn’t possible.
      - Still requires regular DB administration like on-prem systems.
